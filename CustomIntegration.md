# Custom Integration

Since BTCPay Server has an API compatible with Bitpay, it inherits from all its integration to ECommerce solutions with minimal engineering efforts.
You can read the documentation [on Bitpay's website](https://bitpay.com/api#resource-Invoices).

The only difference is that while bitpay support one store per account, BTCPay supports multiple store per account.
