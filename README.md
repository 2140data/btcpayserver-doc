# BTCPay Server Documentation

## Introduction

BTCPay Server is an Open Source payment processor which conforms to the invoice API of Bitpay.
This allows easy migration of your codebase to your own, self-hosted payment processor.

If you have any issues with BTCPay, please file a [github issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/issues).
If you have more general questions, please come on [Slack](http://52.191.212.129:3000/).

This solution is for you if:

* You currently use Bitpay as a payment processor but are worried about their commitment to Bitcoin in the future
* You want to be in control of your own funds
* Bitpay compliance team decided to reject your application
* You want lower fees (we support SegWit)
* You want to become a payment processor yourself and offer BTCPay hosted solution to merchants
* You want a way to support additional currencies not offered by Bitpay
