# BTCPay Server Documentation

## Introduction

BTCPay Server is an Open Source payment processor which conforms to the invoice API of Bitpay.
This allows easy migration of your codebase to your own, self-hosted payment processor.

* You want lower fees (we support SegWit),
* You want to become a payment processor yourself and offer BTCPay hosted solution to merchants
* You want a way to support payment in altcoins (BGold, Dogecoin, Feathercoin, Groestlcoin, Litecoin, Monacoin, Viacoin, POLIS)
