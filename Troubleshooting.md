Facing a problem is never fun. This document explains the most common workflow and steps you should take to easier identify the issue you're having.

## 1. Identifing the problem

## 2. Replicating the issue

## 3. Looking through the logs (optional)

## 4. Finding a solution yourself (FAQ, Wiki, GitHub issues)

Even though the setups differ, the chances that someone else experienced the same issue as yours are pretty high.

### 4.1 BTCPay FAQ

We try to document the most common issues on the [Frequently Asked Questiions page](FAQ.md). Take a look there and see if your question has been documented.

### 4.2 BTCPay Wiki

[BTCPay Server Wiki page](https://nbitstack.com/c/btcpayserver) contains a list of questions and issues from users. Use the search bar in the upper right corner to see if your problem has been documented and if there's a solution to it.

### 4.3 GitHub

When there's an advanced technical issue, users ususally open an issue on GitHub. Take a look at the BTCPay GitHub repository and browse [search the the closed issues](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

## 5. Asking for help

If you're unable to solve the problem yourself, do not worry. There's an engaging community here to help you. 

The better you desribe the problem, the higher are the chances of getting a proper solution. Be concise and provide as much relevant information as possible. Be sure to include the [version you're using](https://nbitstack.com/t/what-is-my-btcpay-server-version/94/2) and describe your BTCPay Setup. Try to describe what you're trying to do and what's the issue. If you can provide the logs.

Here's a good example of how to ask a question.

> I'm having a problem with XYZ. I am able to replicate the problem. My BTCPay version is 0.100.31 and I deployed my server on Digital Ocean by following Docker deployment guide. I've searched though the FAQ, Wiki and closed GitHub issues, but there's no solution to my problem. My BTCPay Setup is XYZ and the issue is occuring when I do XYZ. Here are the logs I was able to get from my BTCPay instance.

### 5.1 Asking the community (general problems)

For quick asnwers to basic problems, it's best to post a question in #help or #general channel on [BTCPay Slack](http://slack.btcpayserver.org/).

### 5.2 Opening an Issue on GitHub (advanced problems)
