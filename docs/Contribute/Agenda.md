# Calls Calendar

All calls, design, development, and Documentation (marketing, SEO) are open to everyone to join. 
If you want to see the upcoming scheduled Calls, follow the guide below. 

Calls are scheduled via Github issues. 
You can find all upcoming calls with their designated tags [Here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/organization/issues)

There are two requirements for an issue to be included:

* The issue needs to include a UTCTime meta property following this format: UTCTime: 2020-10-14 9:00 UTC -7
* A maintainer needs to add the `Call` label to the issue (this prevents spam)
* The calendar auto-updates whenever a new issue is created or an existing issue is edited

## BTCPay Server Organization Calender.

Our calendar (an .iCal file) includes upcoming calls. Qualified issues are automatically added to the calendar, which you can then subscribe to via your favorite calendar tool.
