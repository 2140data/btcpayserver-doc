# Testing BTCPay Server

Testing the software is a great way to contribute to the project. There are many different ways that someone can _test_ the software. Users who manually test the software in order to provide user experience feedback or bugs to the project developers and designers is always appreciated. 

Since the software is open source, anyone can test and audit the code. Some merchants or other technical users may want verify new or existing features by testing the software themselves. Developers working on the code can also benefit from understanding how to manually test certain actions in BTCPay.

This guide will show you how to manually test some common BTCPay features and assumes you already have your [Local Development Environment](ContributeDevCode.md) already set up. Once you understand the basic testing actions, most other features can be manually tested in a similar way.
