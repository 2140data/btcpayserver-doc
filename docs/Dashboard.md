# Dashboard 

This page will tell you about the Dashboard panel in your **BTCPay user interface**.
In BTCPay server 1.5, we've added new panels to the Dashboard page. 
Not only will it now take you through the initial setup of your store's wallet, but once you are set up, you get basic analytics of your store!



## What do the tiles tell?

There are five main sections to the Dashboard. 

* Wallet Balance 
    This is the current store [Wallet](Wallet.md) balance. 
    The view shows a balance graph by Week, Month, or year.

* TX Activity 
    Quickly manage Pending Payouts, view recent TXs, and overview outstanding [refunds](Refund.md)

* Recent Transactions
    The last five transactions are shown.

* Recent Invoices
    The last five invoices are shown with their corresponding status and value.
    It also allows you to go directly to all [invoices](/Invoices.md).

* Current active [Crowdfund](Apps.md/#crowdfunding-app)
    This tile shows the current active Crowdfunds, including their top-ranked items. 
    When more than one active Crowdfund is happening, the panels will show below the initial one. 
    There's easy access to  Crowdfund management or to see all the perks you've set from these panels.
