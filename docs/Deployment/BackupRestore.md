# Back up & Restore. 

In this guide you will get up to speed with BTCPay Server's `Backup & Restore` process, what do you need to keep i mind when doing a backup, whats included in backups and how to restore a backup. 

:::warning
BTCPay Server is and will never be responsible for your backup. 
This process comes with it's warnings and they should be considered. 
Always make sure your backup solution works and fits your needs! 
:::

## How does BTCPay Server backup work? 

The original strategy of backups in BTCPay Server does still exist and can be found [Here](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Docker/#how-can-i-back-up-my-btcpay-server).
While we did create a new process, the old scripts still do work and have only slightly been touched, please see [Github #641](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker/pull/641) for more details. 

:::tip 
Please be aware of these important issues:
Old channel state is toxic and you can loose all your funds, if you or someone else closes a channel based on the backup with old state - and the state changes often! If you publish an old state (say from yesterday's backup) on chain, you WILL LOSE ALL YOUR FUNDS IN A CHANNEL, because the counterparty will publish a revocation key!
:::

The backup process get's started from the `btcpay-backup.sh` script. 
Open a command prompt and type the following 

```
cd "$BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY"
./btcpay-backup.sh
```
When running the above command a bash script will start running your backup. 
Below we talk you through the steps taken. 
The backup process needs to be started as root, which it will check for and let you know if you have to switch user.

```
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then
  printf "\nüö® This script must be run as root.\n"
  printf "‚û°Ô∏è  Use the command 'sudo su -' (include the trailing hypen) and try again.\n\n"
  exit 1
fi
```
After the user has been determined right, the script will set it self up to take the next step:

```
# preparation
docker_dir=$(docker volume inspect generated_btcpay_datadir --format="{{.Mountpoint}}" | sed -e "s%/volumes/.*%%g")
dbdump_name=postgres.sql.gz
btcpay_dir="$BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY/btcpayserver-docker"
backup_dir="$docker_dir/volumes/backup_datadir/_data"
dbdump_path="$docker_dir/$dbdump_name"
backup_path="$backup_dir/backup.tar.gz"

# ensure backup dir exists
if [ ! -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
  mkdir -p $backup_dir
fi
```
With these preparation's taken, backup process is now starting. 
On every step of the way, the script has checks to ensure it either works or either fails with a comprehensive error msg.

```
echo "üö® Database container could not be started or found."
```

If everything is running fine you'll get to see multiple completed marks in your console. 

Example :

``` 
echo "‚úÖ Database dump done."
echo "‚úÖ Archive done."
```

When the backup has completed and ran succesfull it will state :

```
printf "‚úÖ Backup done => $backup_path\n\n"
```

### Extra options for `btcpay-backup.sh`

One of the extra tags that you can set when running the `btcpay-backup.sh` is for a passphrase.
This would be run as follows :

```
cd "$BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY"
./btcpay-backup.sh BTCPAY_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE 
```

Output would look similar to this : 

```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Dumping database ‚Ä¶
‚úÖ Database dump done.

## How does a BTCPay Server Restore work? 

The starting procedure is similar to the `btcpay-backup.sh`. 
But instead of running backup, we run the `btcpay-restore.sh` script. 
This will start the restore process.

```
cd "$BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY"
./btcpay-restore.sh
```

The script will start with the same credential check as the backup. 
Again, this script needs to be run as `root`.

Did you run the backup with `BTCPAY_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` ? Then you do have to run the restore with this tag aswell. 

```
cd "$BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY"
./btcpay-restore.sh BTCPAY_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE
```

If you do not set the flag, the script will give you an error. 

```
printf "\nüîê $backup_path is encrypted. Please provide the passphrase to decrypt it."
```

```
if [[ "$backup_path" == *.gpg ]]; then
  echo "üîê Decrypting backup file ‚Ä¶"
  {
    gpg -o "${backup_path%.*}" --batch --yes --passphrase "$BTCPAY_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE" -d $backup_path
    backup_path="${backup_path%.*}"
    printf "‚úÖ Decryption done.\n\n"
  } || {
    echo "üö®  Decryption failed. Please check the error message above."
    exit 1
  }
fi
```

The restore will stop on any of the errors that it may encounter, like it does with the backup script. 

Example : 

```
 echo "üö®  Restoring volumes failed. Please check the error message above."
```

When all steps complete in a proper mannor, the process will end with : 

```
printf "‚úÖ Restore done\n\n"
```

As one of the steps in the process is to restart your BTCPay Server 

```
printf "\n‚ÑπÔ∏è  Restarting BTCPay Server ‚Ä¶\n\n"
```

When the restore is complete everything should be running again and you've savely restored your BTCpay Server.
Congratulations!

Allways make sure your backup strategy is tested and fits your business needs. There is no one solution fits all.
