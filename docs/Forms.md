BTCPay Server's Forms Builder enables you to request specific information from your customer. 

These forms are fully customizable to suit your requirements. By dragging and dropping the fields you want!
In this introduction we will go through the visual form builder, if you'd like to do more advanced settings, please visit the [Advanced forms](./AdvancedForms.md) section of our documentation.
